# Yeena

Yeena is a stash evaluation tool for Path of Exile named in the vein of the trusty old ATMA V tool for Diablo 2. It allows you to quickly find vendor recipes by connecting to the Path of Exile website and retreiving your stash.

This branch contains version 2, which is under heavy development and not yet suitable for use.
